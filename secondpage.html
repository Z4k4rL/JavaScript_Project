	<h2>YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT ME AND MY COMPUTER SCIENCE JOURNEY THROUGH MY PORTFOLIO!!!!!!</h2>

I HAVE BEEN A COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT SINCE MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, SO THIS MARKS THE MIDWAY POINT THROUGH MY THIRD YEAR OF MY COMPUTER SCIENCE JOURNEY. I HAVE NOT DONE MANY PROJECTS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE SO FAR, BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN. I TOOK DUAL ENROLLED COLLEGE COURSES FOR MY SECOND SEMESTER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE 1, AND ATTEMPTED TO DO SO DURING THE SECOND SEMESTER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE 2. THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY I HAVE BECOME AN ADEPT LEARNER OF PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, XCODE AND JQUERY DUE TO THE EXCELLENCE OF MY COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. MY MOST SIGNIFICANT PROJECT IS THE WEBSITE THAT I AM PRESENTING TO YOU RIGHT NOW! EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT DONE MUCH IN TERMS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE WORTH MENTIONING, I HAVE BEEN TRYING MY BEST DESPITE MANY HARDSHIPS TO PUSH THROUGH AND LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN AND WORK MY HARDEST. I HOPE THAT THIS WEBSITE ALONG WITH MY CONTINUED EDUCATION IN THE COMPUTER SCIENCE WORLD CAN HELP ME LEARN MORE AND DEVELOP AS A PERSON</P>
